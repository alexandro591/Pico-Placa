# Pico-Placa
A program build in Python 3 to check if your car can be on the road of Quito, using the the old and new laws of Ecuador for "pico y placa".

## Example of use
You can find the example code inside the repository, but simply the program creates a PlacaEcuador object, which is an Ecuador valid plate in the format ABC0123 or ABC123 (not case sensitive), then it calls the method of PlacaEcuador called canBeOnTheRoad, which consists of 3 inputs, the date, the time, and the rule "antigua" or "nueva" (optional, not case sensitive). If this rule is not instanced, the default rule is "antigua".

The return of this method is a boolean, on which a true means that you CAN be on the road with the given variables or you CAN'T be on the road if it's false.

```
from placaEcuador import *
myPlaca=PlacaEcuador("GKZ0607")
print(myPlaca.canBeOnTheRoad("23-01-2020","13:00","nueva"))
```
The result is false, it uses the new law.

```
from placaEcuador import *
myPlaca=PlacaEcuador("GKZ0607")
print(myPlaca.canBeOnTheRoad("23-01-2020","13:00","antigua"))
```
The result is true, it uses the old law.

```
from placaEcuador import *
myPlaca=PlacaEcuador("GKZ0607")
print(myPlaca.canBeOnTheRoad("23-01-2020","13:00"))
```
The result is true, it uses the default old law.

## Considerations
- The plate is a string that has to be an Ecuador valid plate which contains only numbers and letters.<br/>
    **Example:** _"ABC0123"_
- The date is a string in the format dd-mm-YY.<br/>
    **Example:** _"28-02-2016"_
- The time is a string in format of 24h.<br/>
    **Example:** _"14:55"_
- The rule and the valid Ecuador plate are NOT case sensitive.<br/>
    **Example:** _"nueva"="Nueva", "UKY0652"="uky0652"_
- The valid Ecuador plate can either be in the new format or the old format.<br/>
    **Example:** _"UKY0652"="UKY652"_
- The time is inclusive, either if you use the new or old law.<br/>
    **Example:** _a car at 19:30 with the old law, in the case that the plate falls inside the date of "pico y placa", can't be on the road, also at 16:00, 9:30 and 7:00_
- The program throws a ValueError when the plate, the date, the time or the rule are not valid.

## Automated testing software
The repository contains an automated testing software for placaEcuador written in python, that creates a random plate, date, time, and rule, and tests it an _nmax_ number of times.

## Instalation
You can clone the repository and use the _placaEcuador.py_ file or you can just simply install it by typing:
```
python3 -m pip install placaEcuador
```
Run the _example.py_ file to test.
